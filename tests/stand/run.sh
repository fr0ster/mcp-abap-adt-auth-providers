# run the tests against them, and stop them again — the same locally and in CI.

# Whoever starts a server stops it, per service: one that was already running
# (from `npm run stand:up`, or started by hand) is left running, and only the
# ones this script started are removed. STAND_KEEP=1 keeps those too.

# Written for Bash 3.2, the /bin/bash macOS still ships: no associative arrays,
# and no arrays at all — an empty one is "unbound" under `set -u` there.
